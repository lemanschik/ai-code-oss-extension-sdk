/**
 * This function reconstructs the file content by applying a streamed diff (in a
 * specialized SEARCH/REPLACE block format) to the original file content. It is designed
 * to handle both incremental updates and the final resulting file after all chunks have
 * been processed.
 *
 * The diff format is a custom structure that uses three markers to define changes:
 *
 *   ------- SEARCH
 *   [Exact content to find in the original file]
 *   =======
 *   [Content to replace with]
 *   +++++++ REPLACE
 *
 * Behavior and Assumptions:
 * 1. The file is processed chunk-by-chunk. Each chunk of `diffContent` may contain
 *    partial or complete SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. By calling this function with each
 *    incremental chunk (with `isFinal` indicating the last chunk), the final reconstructed
 *    file content is produced.
 *
 * 2. Matching Strategy (in order of attempt):
 *    a. Exact Match: First attempts to find the exact SEARCH block text in the original file
 *    b. Line-Trimmed Match: Falls back to line-by-line comparison ignoring leading/trailing whitespace
 *    c. Block Anchor Match: For blocks of 3+ lines, tries to match using first/last lines as anchors
 *    If all matching strategies fail, an error is thrown.
 *
 * 3. Empty SEARCH Section:
 *    - If SEARCH is empty and the original file is empty, this indicates creating a new file
 *      (pure insertion).
 *    - If SEARCH is empty and the original file is not empty, this indicates a complete
 *      file replacement (the entire original content is considered matched and replaced).
 *
 * 4. Applying Changes:
 *    - Before encountering the "=======" marker, lines are accumulated as search content.
 *    - After "=======" and before ">>>>>>> REPLACE", lines are accumulated as replacement content.
 *    - Once the block is complete (">>>>>>> REPLACE"), the matched section in the original
 *      file is replaced with the accumulated replacement lines, and the position in the original
 *      file is advanced.
 *
 * 5. Incremental Output:
 *    - As soon as the match location is found and we are in the REPLACE section, each new
 *      replacement line is appended to the result so that partial updates can be viewed
 *      incrementally.
 *
 * 6. Partial Markers:
 *    - If the final line of the chunk looks like it might be part of a marker but is not one
 *      of the known markers, it is removed. This prevents incomplete or partial markers
 *      from corrupting the output.
 *
 * 7. Finalization:
 *    - Once all chunks have been processed (when `isFinal` is true), any remaining original
 *      content after the last replaced section is appended to the result.
 *    - Trailing newlines are not forcibly added. The code tries to output exactly what is specified.
 *
 * Errors:
 * - If the search block cannot be matched using any of the available matching strategies,
 *   an error is thrown.
